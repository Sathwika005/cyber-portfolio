# DevSecOps

Focus: securing the software delivery pipeline by adding security gates (SAST/SCA/secrets scanning) and documenting findings and remediation.

## What to review first
1) `writeups/` — security gate write-ups with findings and fixes
2) `pipelines/` — pipeline configuration examples
3) `sast-dast-sca/` — scan notes and summaries

## Artifacts in this folder
- **Security gate write-ups:** pipeline stages, results, and pass/fail policy
- **Pipeline configs:** CI examples (e.g., GitHub Actions / Jenkins-style YAML)
- **Scan notes:** what was detected, severity, and remediation approach

## Evidence
- Screenshots: `../evidence/screenshots/`
- Sanitized scan outputs: `../evidence/sanitized-logs/`
