# Cybersecurity Portfolio (SOC/Blue Team + AppSec/DevSecOps)

This repository documents my hands-on cybersecurity work focused on:
- SOC / Blue Team: alert triage, log analysis, incident reporting, and basic detections
- AppSec / DevSecOps: secure SDLC concepts and CI/CD security gates

## Start Here (Best Work)
- SOC Incident Reports: `soc/incident-reports/`
- SOC Detections + Notes: `soc/detections/`
- DevSecOps Pipelines + Security Gates: `devsecops/pipelines/`

## Skills Demonstrated
**SOC / Blue Team**
- Log analysis, alert triage, IOC extraction, incident documentation
- Detection thinking (what to detect, why, and how to tune)

**AppSec / DevSecOps**
- OWASP-aligned AppSec fundamentals
- CI/CD security gates (SAST/SCA/secrets scanning) and remediation notes

## Repository Structure
- `soc/` — SOC labs, detections, incident reports, and write-ups
- `appsec/` — AppSec learning and write-ups
- `devsecops/` — pipeline security, scans, and gate policies
- `templates/` — reusable templates for consistent reporting
- `evidence/` — screenshots and sanitized evidence
