# Application Security (AppSec)

Focus: understanding and documenting common web/application risks, mapped to OWASP concepts, with clear write-ups and evidence.

## What to review first
1) `writeups/` — vulnerability write-ups and threat models
2) `owasp/` — OWASP-aligned notes and checklists

## Artifacts in this folder
- **Vulnerability write-ups:** steps to reproduce, evidence, impact, root cause, and fixes
- **Threat models:** lightweight STRIDE tables + mitigations
- **OWASP notes:** practical summaries that support the write-ups

## Evidence
- Screenshots: `../evidence/screenshots/`
- Sanitized request/response or logs: `../evidence/sanitized-logs/`
